# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and utilizing the [Tailwind Astro Starter Blog template](https://github.com/wanoo21/tailwind-astro-starting-blog) for design.

## Usage

### Extend / Customize

`src/consts.ts` contains a list of constants that you can customize to your liking, including the blog title, description, author, social media links, etc.

`src/functions.ts` contains a list of functions that changes the default behavior of the template, including default post sorting and exclude draft posts.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
